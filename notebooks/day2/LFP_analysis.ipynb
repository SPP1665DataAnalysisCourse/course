      "- To make a better estimate of your spectral densities, you may want to window each LFP trial by a Hanning window (or some other windowing function) that consists of the same number of samples as in the LFP trial. This can be achieved by an element-wise multiplication of the two LFPs by the `scipy.signal.hann()` function. Plot the Hanning function. Does it improve your estimates?\n",
      "- You may want to explore this issue further: Assume the observed phase shifts are caused by a wave of LFP activity propagating across cortex. Given the electrode distance of about 400 microns, the frequency of the beta oscillation and the measured phase shift -- what is the approximate propagation speed?"
